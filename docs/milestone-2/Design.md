### Milestone 2. Technology Proven

Role: Designer Design
Goal: Software Architecture

## SMS Twitter- Software Architecture

### Design Around User Stories

- User- C U D V
- Post- C U D V
- Message- C U D V
- Comment- C D V
- Like- C D V

NOTE: Letters stand for CREATE (C), UPDATE (U), DELETE (D) and VIEW (V).

You can find our complete list of user stories [here](https://github.com/Twitter-Clone/twitter-clone-documentation/blob/master/docs/UserStories.md).

### Design Architecture
- Apps = Data + Views
- The design for the app requires designing the data models and the Views that will be implemented.

You can find our wireframes [here](https://github.com/Twitter-Clone/twitter-clone-documentation/blob/master/docs/milestone-2/Milestone2_wireframe.png).
