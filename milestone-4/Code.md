## Milestone 4. Functionality Complete
Role: Programmer - Code
Goal: Write code - core features

### Implement all user stories
Our user stories can be found [here](https://github.com/Twitter-Clone/twitter-clone-documentation/blob/master/UserStories.md).

### Use Test-driven workflow
We implemented tests for evaluating the success of our HTTP handler successfully storing and retrieving data from our database to our frontend and vise versa. 

### Implementation Cycle


### Implement all core features
Implementing these core features include functionality that a user should be able to expect from a Twitter clone - SMS application such as posting/viewing tweets, registering for an account, messaging other users, etc. Once our API was able to handle HTTP requests across all database tables, we then updated the user interface for the application to seemlessley pass data from all interfaces of the application.
