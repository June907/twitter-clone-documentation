## Twitter-Clone - Continuous integration

### Build and test with every push
* For milestone 4, we were able to test that our views were working. 
* Views would include user_list, user_detail, and tweet_list
* views.py can be found at: https://github.com/Twitter-Clone/twitter-clone-api/blob/master/tcapi/views.py
* We implemented tests that cover the different views
* One major issue that we faced was getting all of our settings configured. We had issues with the API not working correctly, so manual testing was definately used here.


### Implement Test Coverage
* Since the team was attempting to correct the issues that were going on with the api, no test coverage was implemented during this time. 
* Test coverage will be implemented in the future to make clear what code is being tested.
