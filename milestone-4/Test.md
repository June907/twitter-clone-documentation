## Twitter-Clone - Continuous integration

### Build and test with every push
* For milestone 4, the team faced an issue reguarding getting the api connected to the frontend.
* The team was more focussed on going through our api repository and trying to figure out what connections were broken.
* However, with the api not working correctly, the team was able to finish up on the views.py. 
* views.py can be found at: https://github.com/Twitter-Clone/twitter-clone-api/blob/master/tcapi/views.py

### Implement Test Coverage
* Since the team was attempting to correct the issues that were going on with the api, no test coverage was implemented during this time. 
* Test coverage will be implemented in the future to make clear what code is being tested.
